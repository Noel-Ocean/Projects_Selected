%com:	during this utterance a large amount of background noise commences;
	there are people in the next room making much more noise than the
	subject; I have rejected as unfeasible the possession of exotic
	tropical birds or large primates , but the range of sounds produced
	by what I assume to be a brother matches their output precisely;
	there is no reciprocal relationship with the material under
	observation , there are no instances of sensitive interference , no
	timing adjustments , on the part of the calls of the wild; the
	noises (www) have nothing to do with anything but themselves , but
	the subject does retrace and hesitate in response to them
