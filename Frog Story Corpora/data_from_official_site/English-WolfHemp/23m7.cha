@Bg
*CHI:	well [^c] the little boy and his dog (.) go looking for a frog [^c]
	.
*CHI:	and &-um they see one [^c] .
*CHI:	and they go running down [^c] to catch it [^c] .
*CHI:	and they trip on a log [^c] .
*CHI:	and they fall in the water [^c] .
*CHI:	and then the little boy comes up with the pail on his head [^c] .
*CHI:	and then he tries to catch him [^c] but the pail falls over his
	eyes [^c] and the frog leaps away [^c] .
*CHI:	and then they see him on a log [^c] .
*CHI:	and so he tells his dog [^c] to go that way [^c] and he'll go the
	other way [^c] .
*CHI:	and so then they sneak up on him [^c] .
*CHI:	and his dog scares him [^c] .
*CHI:	and he put and knocks the frog off the log [^c] .
*CHI:	gets his dog in the net [^c] .
*CHI:	and frog hauls himself up onto a rock [^c] .
*INV:	mhm [^c] .
*CHI:	and then the little boy yells at him [^c] .
*CHI:	xxx . [+ exc]
%com:	a dog barking outside obscures this utterance and the child's mouth
	is behind the book at that instant , but I don't think he reports
	the boy's yelling
*CHI:	and frog [/] (..) the frog sits on the log [^c] .
*CHI:	and they go further away [^c] .
*CHI:	the frog feels sad [^c] because he wanted [^c] him to chase him
	[^c] .
*CHI:	and so he followed the footprints (.) into the house [^c] .
*CHI:	and into the bathtub [^c] .
*INV:	yeah [^c] .
*CHI:	and he leaped in the bathtub [^c] .
*INV:	yeah [^c] .
*CHI:	<and then that> [//] and he sits on the dog's head [^c] and that's
	the end [^c] .
@Eg
*INV:	are they happy at the end [^c] ?
*CHI:	mhm [^c] .
*INV:	yeah [^c] ?
*INV:	great [^c] .
*INV:	so maybe next you'll get a pet frog [^c] to go with your pet dog
	[^c] .
*INV:	what do you say [^c] ?
*INV:	what do you think [^c] your mom would say to that [^c] ?
*CHI:	we just had .
*INV:	you did [^c] ?
*INV:	<where'd you> [//] you found them in your backyard [^c] ?
