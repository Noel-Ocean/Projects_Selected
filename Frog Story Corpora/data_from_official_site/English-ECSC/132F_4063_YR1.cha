*CHI:	okay .
*CHI:	&-um .
*CHI:	so .
*CHI:	there's a little boy .
*CHI:	that .
*CHI:	gets a package and he's sitting with .
*CHI:	a dog .
*CHI:	a big frog and a turtle .
*CHI:	and he opens up the package and they all look inside .
*CHI:	and .
*CHI:	it's a little .
*CHI:	frog .
*CHI:	and the big frog, doesn't seem too happy .
*CHI:	the boy .
*CHI:	sets down the little frog next to the big frog .
*CHI:	and the big frog .
*CHI:	looks very .
*CHI:	mischievous .
*CHI:	and .
*CHI:	then bites the little frog's leg .
*CHI:	and they're all very surprised .
*CHI:	and so the boy scolds .
*CHI:	the .
*CHI:	big frog .
*CHI:	and .
*CHI:	then they all go for a walk down to the pond .
*CHI:	and the big frog and the little frog are riding on the turtle's back .
*CHI:	and the big frog again doesn't seem too happy .
*CHI:	and he kicks .
*CHI:	the little .
*CHI:	frog off .
*CHI:	of the .
*CHI:	turtle's back .
*CHI:	and the boy .
*CHI:	again .
*CHI:	scolds him .
*CHI:	and the little frog is .
*CHI:	very upset .
*CHI:	and then .
*CHI:	they're going on .
*CHI:	a raft in .
*CHI:	the pond .
*CHI:	but the big frog doesn't, get to come along cause he was mean to the little frog .
*CHI:	and so they're .
*CHI:	going along .
*CHI:	and then the big frog jumps onto the raft .
*CHI:	but the boy doesn't notice .
*CHI:	he's .
*CHI:	looking .
*CHI:	forward .
*CHI:	and so then .
*CHI:	big frog kicks the little frog off and sticks out its tongue .
*CHI:	and then .
*CHI:	and the turtle sees this .
*CHI:	and so the turtle tells the little .
*CHI:	boy what happened .
*CHI:	and then .
*CHI:	the .
*CHI:	boy .
*CHI:	the dog and the turtle all .
*CHI:	are .
*CHI:	mad at the big frog and are .
*CHI:	nervous about the .
*CHI:	little frog so they all go .
*CHI:	looking .
*CHI:	for the little frog .
*CHI:	and .
*CHI:	they can't find him so they all go home .
*CHI:	and the .
*CHI:	big frog feels bad .
*CHI:	because the little boy is crying .
*CHI:	and they're all in the room all upset .
*CHI:	and they look out the window .
*CHI:	and the little frog jumps in and lands on .
*CHI:	the big frog's head .
*CHI:	and then they're all happy .
*CHI:	the end .
